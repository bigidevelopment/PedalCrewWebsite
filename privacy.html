  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025‑09‑23</p>

  <p>PedalCrew is currently in a limited demo/testing phase. This website is a simple static page that does not use cookies or track you. We do not collect personal data on this website.</p>

  <h2>Mobile app</h2>
  <p>The PedalCrew Android app connects to third‑party services to provide core features. These may include Firebase services such as Authentication, Firestore/Database, Cloud Functions, Crashlytics, and optionally Analytics (only if you consent in settings). Your usage of the app is subject to the privacy policies of those providers.</p>

  <h3>What we collect in the app</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account basics</strong>: your Google account UID, email, display name, and optional photo URL.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile fields you provide</strong>: preferred pace, home city, analytics consent, notification preferences.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride data</strong>: rides you create or join, ride status updates, and activity feed entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Points and ranks</strong>: totals and transactions for create/join/complete actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reports</strong>: if enabled, anonymized crash and performance data to improve stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong>: if you opt in, anonymous usage events such as login, ride create/join/leave, filter apply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Permissions</h3>
  <p>The demo build may request network access and Google Sign‑In. We do not request location, contacts, or storage access in this demo scope.</p>

  <h3>How we use your data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you and keep your account in sync across sessions.</li>
    <li>To show, create, and manage rides and participation.</li>
    <li>To compute points and rank levels.</li>
    <li>To improve app quality via crash reports and, if enabled, analytics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data retention</h3>
  <p>Profile and ride data remains in the database until deleted. You can request account deletion at any time (Settings → Delete account in‑app, or email us). Crash and analytics data follow the retention policies of the underlying providers.</p>

  <h3>Your choices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the in‑app toggle to opt in/out of analytics at any time.</li>
    <li>Request account deletion and associated data removal.</li>
    <li>Contact us with any privacy questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
  <p>This demo is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us to remove it.</p>

  <h3>Changes</h3>
  <p>We may update this policy as the demo evolves. Material changes will be reflected by updating the date above.</p>
